# Typed List
This application demonstrates typed list and how it can be used to contain and manipulate data. You can add, insert, delete, get, clone, reverse and clear data. Also you can see tests which confirm the correct working of implemented list.

## Variant
My ID: **1105**.  
Variant: 1105 % 4 =  **1**.  
  
First variant:  
1) Double-linked list.  
2) List based on built-in arrays.  

## Instruction

2. Clone the repository on your local machine.
3. Go to the cloned folder in your terminal.
4. Install node dependencies using `npm i`.
5. Run tests using `npm run test`.

## Conclusion
The tests helped me a lot in the development of this application. The time it taked to build them has paid off. Instead of manually checking every line of code and "compiling" it in head, it's enough to simply create a structure of type *to run* - *to pend* to localize and fix bugs immediately. Tests are an extremely useful and important opportunity in the development of complex programs.
